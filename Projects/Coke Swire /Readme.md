Predictive Maintenance Analysis for Coca-Cola Facilities
Business Problem & Project Objective
Coca-Cola faces significant challenges in managing maintenance across their facilities, with a high number of unplanned maintenance events leading to operational disruptions and increased costs. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast maintenance requirements, helping transition from reactive to proactive maintenance approaches. By analyzing historical maintenance data from various facilities, we aim to identify patterns and predict potential equipment failures before they occur, ultimately reducing downtime and optimizing resource allocation.
Group's Solution to the Business Problem
Our team developed a comprehensive solution utilizing both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict unplanned maintenance events. The initial Logistic Regression model achieved 82.3% accuracy, with precision at 74.5% and recall at 64.2%. We then improved upon these results with a Random Forest model, which achieved superior performance with 87.0% accuracy, 81.2% precision, and 74.8% recall. The Random Forest model particularly excelled at identifying location-specific maintenance patterns and equipment age impacts, providing more nuanced predictions than the simpler logistic approach.
My Contribution to the Project
In this project, I took the lead on:

Data preprocessing and cleaning, handling missing values and standardizing formats
Developing and implementing both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
Creating visualizations for missing data analysis and maintenance patterns
Conducting statistical analysis to identify key predictive factors
Interpreting model results and translating them into actionable insights
Documenting the technical approach and findings

Business Value of the Solution
Our predictive maintenance solution delivers substantial business value through:

Reduction in unplanned downtime by enabling proactive maintenance scheduling
Cost savings through better resource allocation and maintenance planning
Improved operational efficiency across different facilities
Enhanced equipment longevity through timely interventions
Data-driven decision making for maintenance operations

The Random Forest model's superior performance (87% accuracy) translates to potentially preventing thousands of hours of unplanned downtime annually.
