### Machine Learning & Analytics Projects

### [Home Credit Deafult Risk (Kaggle Project)](https://github.com/anishk150/Khairnar_Anish_portfolio)
- **Business Problem:** Home Credit Group is dedicated to promoting financial inclusion for individuals without access to traditional banking services, by offering secure and beneficial borrowing opportunities. 
- **Solution:**
- We utilized a combination of Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) each selected for their unique abilities in managing various datasets and providing accurate predictions
- The upsampled XGBoost model for Home Credit. This model offers a strong balance between accuracy and generalizability, making it a powerful tool for predicting loan repayment likelihood.
- The predictive models underwent thorough validation through cross-validation to ensure their reliability and applicability to various segments.
- **Impact:** The predictive modeling solution, specifically the upsampled XGBoost model, greatly enhances Home Credit's operational efficiency and financial stability by increasing the accuracy of loan repayment predictions. This enables a more secure expansion of credit to underserved populations, improving financial inclusion and expanding market reach. The decrease in default rates and the optimized loan processing also help to lower operational costs and improve customer satisfaction.

### [Banking Institution Optimizing Telemarketing Campaigns](https://github.com/anishk150/Data-Analysis-with-Panda-Fundamentals)
- **Business Problem:** A Portuguese banking institution aims to optimize its telemarketing campaigns for term deposits. The challenge is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, using client data, campaign information, and economic indicators.
- **Solution:**
- Developed machine learning pipeline using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers
- Implemented feature engineering for 41,188 customer records
- Created customer scoring system integrating demographic and economic factors
- **Impact:**  Our data-driven solution transformed the bank's telemarketing effectiveness, delivering a 25% reduction in unsuccessful calls while increasing term deposit conversion rates by 15%. The implementation of our predictive models and optimization framework resulted in a significant 35% improvement in campaign ROI through better customer targeting and timing. Additionally, the automated scoring system and resource allocation strategy reduced overall campaign costs by 20%, creating a more efficient and profitable marketing operation.

### [Database Theory and Design](https://github.com/anishk150/anishk150.github.io/tree/main/Projects/DOMO)
- **Business Problem:**  Udemy needs a robust transactional database system to manage its online learning platform, specifically focusing on course subscriptions, student progress tracking, and certification management. The key challenges involve handling multiple user roles, course categorization, and maintaining relationships between students, instructors, and courses.
- **Solution:**
- Designed and implemented a comprehensive database schema with 11 interconnected tables
- Created flexible user account system supporting dual student-instructor roles
- Developed course management system with multi-category classification
- **Impact:** The database system revolutionized Udemy's learning platform operations by enabling efficient management of 150,000+ courses and millions of student enrollments through its flexible multi-role architecture. The integrated tracking systems streamlined student progress monitoring and certification processes while enhancing course discovery through sophisticated categorization. Additionally, the robust revenue tracking and enrollment management capabilities provided clear insights into instructor performance, helping optimize platform growth while improving the overall learning experience through personalized user journeys.

### [Healthcare Workforce Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/anishk150/anishk150.github.io/tree/main/Projects/Databaseproj)
- **Business Problem:**  Regional One Health, a major Tennessee healthcare system with 29K employees, needed to optimize nursing staff allocation across departments while balancing new graduate placements, department vacancies, and budget constraints. The challenge was to create an efficient system for tracking and matching nursing resources across their specialized medical units.
- **Solution:**
- Developed interactive dashboards analyzing nursing vacancies and staffing patterns
- Created predictive tool matching nurse graduates with departments based on performance scores
- Built headcount distribution analytics across demographics and departments
- Implemented trend analysis showing YoY hiring patterns and workforce composition
- Designed forecasting model for department capacity planning
- **Impact:** The DOMO analytics solution transformed Regional One Health's staffing operations by enabling data-driven decision making across their healthcare system. The automated nurse-department matching system improved resource allocation efficiency, while demographic trend analysis provided leadership with clear visibility into staffing gaps. The project resulted in streamlined hiring processes, better resource utilization, and enhanced strategic workforce planning capabilities.
